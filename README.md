# The Tuva Project 

## 🧰  What is the Tuva Project?
The Tuva Project is a collection of data marts and terminology code sets that transform healthcare data for analytics.

**Data Marts:**
- [CCSR](models/ccsr)
- [Chronic Conditions](models/chronic_conditions)
- [Claims Preprocessing](models/claims_preprocessing)
- [CMS-HCCs](models/cms_hcc)
- [Core](models/core)
- [Financial PMPM](models/financial_pmpm)
- [Quality Measures](models/quality_measures)
- [Readmissions](models/readmissions)

You can find all the terminology sets **[here](seeds/terminology)**.  In many cases the actual terminology code sets are too large to maintain on GitHub, so we main them in an AWS S3 bucket.  However when you run the Tuva Project they are loaded into data warehouse just as they would be as if they were seed files.
