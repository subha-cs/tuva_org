The Tuva Project is open source software that cleans and transforms messy healthcare data.  It does 2 main things:

1. Normalizes data into a common quality-tested format
2. Enriches data with high-level concepts relevant for healthcare

## Pre-requisites
1. You have healthcare data (e.g. EHR, claims, lab, HIE, etc.) in a data warehouse
2. You have [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) installed and configured (i.e. connected to your data warehouse)

[Here](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/installation) are instructions for installing dbt.

## Installation

Execute the following steps to load all seed files, build all data marts, and run all data quality tests in your data warehouse:

1. Add the following to your project's `packages.yml` file:

```yaml
packages:
  - tuva_dbt_core
    revision: 0.2.0
```

2. Run `dbt deps` to install `tuva_dbt_core`
2. Run `dbt seed` to seed tuva core terminology files.

**TODO finish instructions**

3. Create source data tables in your data warehouse
    - note: these tables must match table names and column names exactly as in [source.yml](models/source.yml)
4. Configure [dbt_project.yml](/dbt_project.yml)
    - profile: set to 'tuva' by default - change this to an active profile in the profile.yml file that connects to your data warehouse
    - vars: configure source_name, source database name, and source schema name
5. Run project
    1. Navigate to the project directory in the command line
    2. Execute "dbt build" to create all tables/views in your data warehouse
