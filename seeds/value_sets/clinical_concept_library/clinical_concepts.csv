By design, the phrase is intended to subsume the disease concepts of ""abuse"" and ""dependence"" of a psychoactive substance.  Not all use of a psychoactive substance meets the diagnostic criteria for use disorder, so this value set may not identify all individuals who are known to their health care team to use alcohol.

However, in practice, postbronchodilator airflow limitation is common in both conditions, and common convention considers these conditions to constitute types of COPD.

The significance of this scope is that these are thromboses that pose a particular risk for pulmonary embolism.

Included:
1. Thrombosis of any ""deep vein"" in the upper extremity, described as a ""deep vein"" or with reference to the specific vein (including the brachial, axillary, and/or subclavian veins)
2. Thrombosis of any ""deep vein"" in the lower extremity, whether proximal or distal to the knee, described as a ""deep vein"" or with reference to the specific vein (including the common femoral vein, deep femoral vein, femoral vein, popliteal vein, peroneal vein, anterior and posterior tibial veins, and so-called ""muscular veins of the calf"")

4. Thrombosis of a central vein, so described or naming the specific vein (including the brachiocephalic, subclavian, and common and external iliac veins, as well as the superior and inferior vena cava).

Notes-
1. Codes using the phrasing of ""embolism and thrombosis of <deep vein>"" are considered in scope.
2. While ""thrombophlebitis"" implies thrombosis (with the added pathophysiologic feature of inflammation), terms phrased as ""phlebitis and thrombophlebitis"" imply a scope that includes both thrombophlebitis and isolated inflammation of a vein without thrombos (i.e. ""phlebitis"").  Since such codes do not necessarily imply the presence of thrombosis, they are not considered in scope.

1. Venous thrombosis or thromboembolism without specification of deep vein involvement
2. Cerebral venous thrombosis.  This condition is generally considered as distinct from DVT of the extremities or pelvis, primarily because a) it does not pose the same risk for pulmonary embolism as extremity or pelvic DVT, and also b) the risk factors are somewhat distinct and b) not all cerebral veins are considered ""deep veins"".
3. Retinal vein occlusion, for the same reasons as #2 above

It does not include fractures of the acetabulum, despite the acetabulum being part of the hip joint, since such fractures are distinct in terms of epidemiology, injury mechanism, and treatment, and are generally not referred to by the term ""hip fracture"".

Note that the scope includes two subtypes of hip fracture (#s 8 and 9 below) which may not correspond to the clinical intent of identifying ""hip fracture"" for some use cases, since they occur exclusively in young individuals (#8) or because they tend to be associated with vigorous physical activity rather than minor trauma in frail and/or osteoporotic individuals.  If needed, a separate value set could be created excluding those hip fracture subtypes.

Included:
1. Any assertion of ""hip fracture"".
2. Any assertion of fracture of the ""proximal femur"", since that term, in both SNOMED-CT and the Foundational Model of Anatomy, does not include the femoral shaft and thus would conform to the general scope described above.
